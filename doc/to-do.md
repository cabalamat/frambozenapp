# To-do List

Things to do for Frambozen and Bozen.

## CSS

Change CSS classes from `.tabs3`, `.tab3-selected` etc to something beginning `bz-` or `fbz-` (the latter if we decide to make the Frambozen CSS distinct from the Bozen CSS).

## Python

Change `hpic()` and `hpex()` in templates to something nicer.
